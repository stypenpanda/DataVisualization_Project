	The data used for this project are originating from many different sources which are described here.
	
	<h2>Migration data</h2>
	The migration data is from the UN and its report <a id="main" href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/migrationflows.shtml">International migration flows to and from selected countries<a>: The 2015 revision</a>.<br>
	The aggregated country data can be found <a id="main" href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/data/UN_MigFlow_Totals.xlsx">here</a>. The migration flows between country is based on <a id="main" href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/data/UN_MigFlow_All_CountryFiles.zip">this data</a>.

	In many cases there have been many data points per country and year. This resulted in the following rule set of selecting the country data:<br><br>
	Coverage (foreigners vs. citizens vs both)
	<ul id="lists">
		<li id="i">In general both have been selected</li>
		<li id="i">For Canada, US & New Zealand <i>both</i> is not availabe, <i>foreigners</i> selected</li>
	</ul>
	Criteria (Citizenship vs. place of birth vs. residence)
	<ul id="lists">
		<li id="i">For most countries only the criteria <i>residence</i> was left after selecting <i>both</i> as coverage</li>
		<li id="i">For France <i>citizenship</i> and <i>residence</i> have been left but only residence had data for immigrants and emigrants therefore his has been selected</li>
		<li id="i">The US have only data for the criteria <i>place of birth</i></li>
		<li id="i">Canada has only data for the criteria <i>citizenship</i></li>
		<li id="i">For New Zealand <i>residence</i> has been selected</li>
	</ul>

	For more details about the selection criteria and where the respective data is coming from, please have a look in the <a id="main" href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/docs/migflows2015documentation.pdf">documentation from the UN</a>.

	<h2>Countries and continents</h2>
	The allocation of countries to continents is based on <a id="main" href="https://www.worlddata.info/downloads/">worlddata.info</a>.

	<h2>Centroids of countries</h2>
