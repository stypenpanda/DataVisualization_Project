  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  In today's times a lot is being discussed about migration. Many people have the feeling that there is more migration than there has been in the past.<br>
  But often these discussions are not based on actual data. Even though the UN provides data about global migration flows, they do not provide them in a human-consumable way.
  Rather these files are pure data walls which make people rather hesitant to have a look at them. <br><br>
  For sure, these visualitions cannot answer all questions and they also limited by the data provided like the following:
  <ul id="lists">
	<li id="i">Many countries, including the US, do not seem to publish emigration data</li>
	<li id="i">There are years where only for a selection of the countries data is available</li>
	<li id="i">Data from African or Southamerican countries is totally missing</li>
  </ul>
  But they give you a start to get a feeling how the migration has changed in the past.
  <h3>Questions you might get answered</h3>
  Within <b>Migration of countries</b> you could answer questions like:
   <ul  id="lists">
	<li id="i">Which countries had the most immigrants or emigrants in the respective year?</li>
	<li id="i">How did this change over the years?</li>
	<li id="i">Is this specific country rather an immigration or an emigration country?</li>
  </ul>
  Within <b>Top yearly migration flows</b> start trying to find answers to the following questions:
   <ul  id="lists">
	<li id="i">In which year did we have the strongest migration from one country to another?</li>
	<li id="i">Have there been years when one country has been the migration target of many people from many different countries?</li>
	<li id="i">Are the main geographical migration flows changing over time?</li>
